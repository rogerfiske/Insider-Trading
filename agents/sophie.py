"""
Sophie -- the consensus analyst.

Reads the rolling 7-day window of scout signals from the state store.
Fires a CONSENSUS event when >= MIN_AGREE scouts agree on the same ticker
+ direction within the window.

Schedule: every 30 minutes (light-touch -- just reads + writes the DB).

Sophie does NOT call Claude. She is pure local logic.
